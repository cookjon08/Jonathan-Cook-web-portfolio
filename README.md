# Jonathan-Cook-web-portfolio

Hello and welcome to my web development portfolio. Through this repository, I aim to chart the skills I have acquired since beginning my programming career. Thus, it will be updated over time with new projects and features.

As well, a future goal is to create an interactive section where I catalogue my previous career as a newspaper journalist and editor.

# Home

On the home page, I display a hero with a randomized, rotating array of photos from my life. Refresh the page to see them all!

# About me

Born and raised in New Jersey, I moved to Montreal in 2014 to pursue an education at Concordia University to study journalism. Notably, I was editor-in-chief at The Link Newspaper, received national nominations for best writing in two categories, and freelanced for publications such as Vice Sports and The Montreal Gazette. My programming career began in February 2024 through the Concordia University Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

I strive to make all of my work readable and accessible to anyone with any device. With this philosophy, I made the portfolio responsive to all types of viewports. I hope to further enhance its readability as I develop my skills in React.

# Projects

Currently, I chose to include one project that I worked on during my bootcamp. It is a functional Tic-Tac-Toe app that I built the player-name inputs, starting-player randomizer, and game logic for. As the app is not hosted anywhere, I decided to include a gif to demonstrate how it plays.

# Skills

I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, and React. I also have experience using the platform MongoDB.
